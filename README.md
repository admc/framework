The goal of this was to build a web app from the ground up using composable small modules to handle all the different things I relied upon with Geddy or Sails.js.

### Setup ###

* Clone
* npm install
* setup postgres (the .app works great)
* create a development database: 'create database demo_dev;'
* sudo npm install -g sequelize-cli
* sequelize db:migrate
* sequelize db:seed
* gulp dev
* localhost:3000 - admin:testing
